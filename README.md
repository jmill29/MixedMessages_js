## Project Description
This is a fairly simple project that uses JavaScript to generate random messages and output them to the user.
The primary objective of this project is to portray the author's abilities in writing JavaScript, accomplishing
tasks such as the creation and use of various JavaScript objects - including dictionaries, lists and strings - 
and using their respective methods.    

## Features
- Capable of outputting more than one type of message, with options ranging from horoscope readings to
inspirational quotes.
- If the user chooses to receive an inspirational quote, the program will output three types of quotes: 
one from a modern-day celebrity, one from a historical figure and one from an ancient proverb.

## How to Use
Launch in a code editor, then write a function call to the generate_message function, passing in one of
three possible arguments, depending on the type of message the user wishes to receive:
- Pass in <strong>'horoscope'</strong> for a horoscope reading
- Pass in <strong>'fortune'</strong> for a fortune telling
- Pass in <strong>'inspiration'</strong> for an inspirational quote
